## Reflection Document

### HTML

#### 01-html Notebook Reflection

I was able to complete the exercises on my own. The
exercises in this section I found to be helpful in
refreshing my memory on html syntax. One exercise
that was particularly helpful was the table exercise.
Right now, I have nothing that I wish that had been
explained better. Because the reading links showed
examples and explained each concept, they really helped
me complete these exercises. I do think an exercise for
the meta tag would have helped me learn this weeks topic
a bit better.

### Accessibility

#### 02-a11y Notebook Reflection

I was able to complete the exercises on my own. For this
exercises, it wouldn't say it was helpful, but it was
more of a refresher of the 01-html exercises. There is
nothing for these exercises that I wish had been explained
better. The 01-html 04-form exercise did helped me learn this
week's topic a little better because the exercise is
heavily based on html forms.

### CSS

#### 03-css Notebook Reflection

For most of the exercises, I was able to complete the
exercises on my own, but I did use the video solution
for the 05-position exercise. The exercises I found
was helpful in learning what each material is suppose
to teach you. I think the exercise that was particularly
helpful is 06-media-queries because it helped me understand
how websites are able to adjust with different screen sizes.
With the exercises, I think explaining the box model would
be something I wish had been explained better. I took a bit
of time learning how box model behaves with parent and child
elements. There were no other exercises that might have helped
me learn this week's topic a bit better.
