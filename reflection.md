### HTML

#### 01-html Homework Reflection

I was able to complete the exercises on my own. The
exercises in this section I found to be helpful in
refreshing my memory on html syntax. One exercise
that was particularly helpful was the table exercise.
Right now, I have nothing that I wish that had been
explained better. Because the reading links showed
examples and explained each concept, they really helped
me complete these exercises. I do think an exercise for
the meta tag would have helped me learn this weeks topic
a bit better.
