## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete the exercises on my own. The
exercises in this section I found to be helpful in
refreshing my memory on html syntax. One exercise
that was particularly helpful was the table exercise.
Right now, I have nothing that I wish that had been
explained better. Because the reading links showed
examples and explained each concept, they really helped
me complete these exercises. I do think an exercise for
the meta tag would have helped me learn this weeks topic
a bit better.

### Accessibility

I was able to complete the exercises on my own. For this
exercises, it wouldn't say it was helpful, but it was
more of a refresher of the 01-html exercises. There is
nothing for these exercises that I wish had been explained
better. The 01-html 04-form exercise did helped me learn this
week's topic a little better because the exercise is
heavily based on html forms.

### CSS

For most of the exercises, I was able to complete the
exercises on my own, but I did use the video solution
for the 05-position exercise. The exercises I found
was helpful in learning what each material is suppose
to teach you. I think the exercise that was particularly
helpful is 06-media-queries because it helped me understand
how websites are able to adjust with different screen sizes.
With the exercises, I think explaining the box model would
be something I wish had been explained better. I took a bit
of time learning how box model behaves with parent and child
elements. There were no other exercises that might have helped
me learn this week's topic a bit better.

### FLEXBOX

I was able to complete the exercises on my own, except for
the last problem where I used the solution. The exercises were helpful to explain how
flexbox works and I think all exercises were helpful to showcase
the main flexbox properties. I do wish the flex order problem for the
exercises was explained better. There are no other exercises that might
have helped me learn this week's topic better.

### CSS GRID

I was able to complete the exercises on my own. I find the exercises for
the grid and grid areas helpful as a review or refresher of the topic. The
grid areas exercises was particularly helpful for me to see how you can
make grids responsive and to make grids easily formatted. For me, all
exercises here explained the main concepts. There were no exercises that
might have helped me learn this week's topic better.

### BOOTSTRAP

I was able to complete the bootstrap exercises on my own. The exercises in
this section were helpful to style html elements more easily via class
components. Since bootstrap 5 documentation explains very well on the
exercises and outside the exercises, there is nothing I wish had been
explained better. There are no other exercises that might have helped
me learn this week's topic better

### JAVASCRIPT

I was able to complete the javascript exercises on my own. I did find the
exercises helpful for seeing how we are able to use javascript to add
event listeners to HTML elements and for showcasing how functional javascript
works. I don't have anything I wish that had been explained better. The exercises
here showcased the main uses of javascript. There were no exercises that might
have helped me learn this week's topic better.
